1. Basic Probability Concepts
Probability

    Probability is the likelihood or chance of an event happening.
    It’s a value between 0 and 1, where 0 means the event won’t happen, and 1 means the event will definitely happen.

Event

    An event is any outcome or combination of outcomes from a random experiment.
        Simple events: Single outcomes (e.g., rolling a 3 on a die).
        Compound events: Multiple outcomes (e.g., rolling an even number).

Types of Events

    Independent events: The outcome of one event does not affect the other.
    Dependent events: The outcome of one event affects the outcome of the other.
    Mutually exclusive events: Two events cannot occur at the same time (e.g., rolling a 3 and a 5 on the same roll of a die).
    Non-mutually exclusive events: Two events can occur together (e.g., drawing a red card and a heart in a deck of cards).

Conditional Probability

    Conditional probability is the probability of one event occurring given that another event has already occurred.
        Formula: P(A∣B)=P(A∩B)P(B)P(A∣B)=P(B)P(A∩B)​
    Bayes' Theorem: A way of updating the probability of an event based on new evidence:
    P(A∣B)=P(B∣A)⋅P(A)P(B)
    P(A∣B)=P(B)P(B∣A)⋅P(A)​

2. Expected Value (EV)
Expected Value (Mean)

    The expected value is the long-term average or the center of a probability distribution.
    For discrete random variables, the expected value is:
    E(X)=∑(x⋅P(x))
    E(X)=∑(x⋅P(x)) where xx represents the outcomes, and P(x)P(x) represents their probabilities.

Example of Expected Value:

    If you roll a fair die, the expected value is the average of all possible outcomes:
    E(X)=1+2+3+4+5+66=3.5
    E(X)=61+2+3+4+5+6​=3.5 This means, on average, the result of rolling the die is 3.5.

3. Deviation, Variance, and Standard Deviation
Variance

    Variance measures how far the numbers are spread out from the mean.
    Formula:
    Variance=1N∑(xi−μ)2
    Variance=N1​∑(xi​−μ)2 where xixi​ represents individual data points, and μμ is the mean.
    It tells you how much the numbers in a data set vary from the expected value.

Standard Deviation

    The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It gives the spread of a distribution in the same units as the data.
    Formula:
    Standard Deviation=Variance
    Standard Deviation=Variance

    ​

4. Random Walk
What is a Random Walk?

    A random walk is a mathematical process where each step taken is determined randomly.
    In simple cases (like flipping a coin), each step is either a movement to the left or right, and the total position depends on the number of steps and the sequence of outcomes.

Example:

    A person starts at position 0 and flips a fair coin:
        Heads means move one step to the right (+1).
        Tails means move one step to the left (-1).
        After nn flips, their position is the sum of all the individual flips.

Expected Position in Random Walk:

    For a fair coin, the expected position after nn flips is 0, since there is an equal probability of moving left or right.

Variance in Random Walk:

    The variance after nn flips is equal to nn, since each flip contributes a variance of 1 to the total variance.

Standard Deviation in Random Walk:

    The standard deviation of the position after nn flips is the square root of the variance:
    Standard Deviation=n
    Standard Deviation=n

    ​

5. Specific Problems Covered
Example 1: Expected Value of Rolling a Die Twice

    You roll a fair six-sided die twice. What is the expected value of the sum of the rolls?
        The expected value of one roll is 3.53.5, so the expected value of the sum after two rolls is 3.5+3.5=73.5+3.5=7.

Example 2: Variance of the Sum of Rolls

    You roll a fair six-sided die twice. What is the variance of the sum of the rolls?
        The variance for one roll is 35121235​, so the variance of the sum is 2×3512=3562×1235​=635​.

Example 3: Probability with Balls (Without Replacement)

    A box contains 5 blue balls and 7 green balls. If 3 balls are drawn without replacement, the probability that all three balls are green is calculated using combinations.

Example 4: Random Walk with Coin Flips

    A person flips a coin nn times. The expected position is 0, and the standard deviation after nn flips is nn

    ​.

Summary

    Probability: The likelihood of an event occurring, ranging from 0 to 1.
    Expected Value (EV): The average or mean outcome of a random variable.
    Variance & Standard Deviation: Measures of the spread or dispersion of data points from the mean.
    Random Walk: A process where each step is determined randomly, and the total position is the sum of all steps.
